<h1><b>Backtracking</b></h1>

 <br>

 <p> backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
 



<p> the usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options,and you must choose one of these. after you make your
    choice you will get a new set of options;just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. this procedure 
    is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. if you made a good sequence of choices,your final state is a goal state;if 
    you didn't,it isn't</p>

<p> conceptually,you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves,though it may be that
    the leaves are all good or all bad.you want toget to a good leaf.at each node,beginning with the root,you choose one of its
    children to move to,and you keep this up until you get to a leaf</p>
 

    
<p> Suppose you get to a bad leaf.You can backtrack to continue the search for a good by revoking your most recent choice,
    and trying out the next option in that set of options.ifyou run out of options,revoke the choice that got you here,and try
    another choice at that node.if you end up at the root with no options left,there are no good lraves to be found.</p>

 <p> This needs an example.</p>
 <br>
 <img src="./Image_root.png" alt="abcd" />
<ol>
    <li> starting at root,your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
    <li>At A,your options are C and D.You choose C.</li>
    <li> C is bad.go back to A.</li>
    <li> At A,you have already tried C,and it failes.Try D.</li>
    <li> D is bad.Go back to A</li>
    <li> At A,you have no options left to try.go back to Root.</li>
    <li> AT ROOT YOU HAVE ALREADY TRIED A. Try B.</li>
    <li>At B,your options are E and F.Try E.</li>
    <li> E is good.Congratulations!</li>    
</ol> 
<br>
<p> in this example we drew a piture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could
        make.There is also a data structure called a tree,but ysally we don't have structure to tell us what choices we
        have.(if we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)
</p>
<pre>
    <font color="blue">
    boolean solve(Node n){
       if n is a leaf node {
         if the leaf is a goal node,return true
         else return failes
       } else{
        for each child c of n {
            if solve(c) succeeds,return true
        }
       return false
    }
}  
</font>    
</pre>
 

<p> Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean fuction.this is essential to understanding the algorithm if
    solve(n) is true,that means node n is part of a solution--that is,node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to
    some goal node.We say that n is solvable.if solve(n) is false,then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
</p>
<h2> How does this work?</h2>
<ul>
    <li> if any child of n is solvable,then n is solvable.</li>
    <li> if no child of n is solvable,then n is not solvable</li>
</ul>

<p> Heance,to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable(part of a path to a goal node),all you have to do is test whethere any
    child of n is solvable.This is done recursiverly,on each child of n. In the above code,this is done by the lines 
</p>
<pre>
    <font color="blue">
     if n is a leaf node {
        if the leaf is a goal node,return true
        else return false
     }
    </font>  
</pre>

<p> The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:
</p>


<h3> <ul> <li> To search a tree:</li></ul></h3>
<ol>
    <li> if the tree consists of a single leaf,test whether it is a goal node.</li>
    <li> Otherwise,search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node,or until you have
        searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
</ol>



<h4><b> Non -recursive backtracking,using a stack</b></h4>

<p> Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm,and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm.in fact,
    that is how your recursive algrorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
</p>

<pre>
    <font color="blue">
    boolean solve(Node n){
     put node n on the stack;
      While the stack is not empty {
       if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
         if it is a goal node,return true
           else pop it off the stack
       }
        else{
          if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
             push the next untried child onto the stack
           else pop the node off the stack 
           
           
        }
       return false
    }
</font>
</pre>

<p> Starting from the root,the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are of the node currently on the top of the 
    stack,and these are only pushed on one child at a time;hence,the stack at all times describe a valid path in the
    tree.nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents.therefore,
    if the root node gets removed(making the stack empty),there must have been no goal nodes at all,and no solution to the
    problem.
</p>

<p> When the stack algorithm terminates sucessfully,the nodes on the stack from(in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal
    node.
</p>

<p> similarly,when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node,the path information is embodied(in reverse order) in the sequence of
    recursive calls.thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time,by(for instance) printing the Node
    at the current level, or storing it in an array.
</p>

<p> here is the recursive backtracking algorithm,modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the sucessful path;</p>

<pre>
    <font color="blue">
    boolean solve(node n) {
     if n is a leaf node {
       if the leaf is a goal node {
        print n
        return true
       }
         else return false
    }else {
       for each child c of n {
        if solve(c) succeeds {
           print n 
           retur true
         }
      }
      return false
    }
}
</font>
</pre>

<h4> Keeping backtracking simple</h4>

<p> All of these version of the backtracking algorithm are pretty  simple,but when applied to a real problem,they can get pretty
    cluttered up with details.even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex.
</p>

<p>for example,if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem,the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate
    solutions
</p>

<p> To keep the program clean,therefore,tests like this should be buried in methods.in a chess game,for example,you could test
    whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b>(or you could even call it <b>isleaf</b>).This method would encapsulate all the
    ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
</p>

<p> Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track,for each node on the current path,which of its chilren have
    been tried already(so we don't have to try them again).in the above code we made this look simple,by just saying<b> for each child
    c of n.</b>in reality,it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are,and there may be no obvious way to step thorough
    them.in chess,for example,a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard,and each child of that node can
    represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move,How do you find these children,and how do you keep track
    of which ones you've already examined?
</p>

<p> The most straightforwards way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows:upon initial entry to the
    node(that is,when you first get there from above),mave a list of all its children.As you try each child,take it off the list.when
    the list is empty,there are no remaining untried children,and you can return"failure."This is a simole approach,but it may require
    quite a lot of additional work.
</p>

<p> There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried,if you can define an ordering on the children.if there is an
    ordering.and you know which child you just tried,you can determine which child to try next.
</p>

<p>For example,you might be able to number the<b>children 1 through n,</b>and try them in numerical order.then,if you have just tried
   <b>child k,</b>you know that you have already tried children 1 through<b>k-1,</b>and you have not yet tried children<b>k+1</b>through
   <b>n.</b>or,if you are trying to color a map with just four colors,you can always try<b>red first,then yellow,then green,then blue.</b>
   if child yellow fails,you know to try child green next.if you are searching a maze,you can try choices in the order left,strating right
   <b>(or perhapsnorth,east,south,west).</b>
</p>

<p> it isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node.<b>In the chess game example,</b> you might number your
    pieces(or perhaps the squares of the board)and try them in numerical order;but in assition each piece may also have several
    moves,and these must also be ordered
</p>

<h6> Example:Tree Search</h6>

<p> For starters,let's do the simplest posssible example of backtracking,which is searching an actual tree.We will also use the
    simplest kind of use of tree,a binary tree.
</p>

<p> A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes,One node is designated as the root node.Each node can referance (point
    to)zero,one,or two other nodes,which are called its children.The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child.
    All nodes are reachable(by one or more steps)from the root node,and there are no cycles.For our purposes,although this is not
    paet of the definition of a binary tree,we will say that a node might not be a goal node,and will contain its name. The
    first example in this paper(which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.
</p>
<p> Here's a definition of the Binary Tree class:</p>

<pre>
    <font color="blue">
    public class BinaryTree{
     BinaryTree leftchild=null;
     BinaryTree rightchild=null;
     boolean isGoalNode=false;
     String name;


     BinaryTree(String name,Binarytree left,BinaryTree right,boolean isGoalNode) {
        this.name=name;
        leftchild=left;
        rightchild=right;
        this.isGoalNode=isGoalNode;
     }
    }
</font>
</pre>

<p> Next We will creat a TreeSearch class,and in it we will define a method make tree()which constructs the above binary tree.</p>

<pre>
    <font color="blue">
    Static Binary Tree makeTreel(){
        Binary Tree root,a,b,c,d,e,f;
       c= new binary tree("C",null,null,false);
       d= new binary tree("D",null,null,false);
       e= new binary tree("E",null,null,false);
       f= new binary tree("F",null,null,false);
       a= new binary tree("A",null,null,false);
       b= new binary tree("B",null,null,false);
       root= new binary tree("Root",a,b,false);
       return root;
    }
</font> 
    </pre>

    <p> Here's a main program to creat a binary tree and try to solve it;
    </p>

    <pre>
        <font color="blue">
        public static void main(string args[]){
            BinaryTree tree=mankTree();
            System.out.printin(solvable(tree));
        }   
    </font>
    </pre>

    <p> And finally,here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>

    <pre>
        <font color="blue">
        static boolean solvable(binary Tree node) {
        /*1*/ if (node==null)return false;
        /*2*/ if (node.isGoalNode)return true;
        /*3*/ if (solvable(node.leftChild))return true;
        /*4*/ if (solvabke(node.rightchild))return true;
        /*5*/ return false;
        
        }
    </font>
    </pre>

    <p> Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> if we are giving a null node,it's not solvable.This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node,without
            first checking whether those children actually exist.</li>
        <li> if the node we are given is a goal node,return sucess.</li>
        <li> see if the left child of node is solvable,and if so,conclude that node is solvable.We will only get to this line if node is non-null
            and is not a goal node,says to</li>
        <li> Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
        <li> since neither child of node is solvable,node itself is not solvable.</li>   
    </ol>

    <p> This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p>
     
    <p> Each time we ask for another node,we have to check if it is null.in the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable An
        alternative would be to check first whether each child exists,and recur only if they do.here's that alternative version:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <font color="blue">
        static boolean solvable(Binary Tree node) {
          if(node.isGoalNode) return true;
          if(node.leftchild!=null && solvable(node.leftchild)) return true;
          if(node.leftchild!=null && solvable(node.rightchild)) return true;
          return false;
          
        }
    </font>
    </pre>

    <p> I think the first version is simpler,but the secound version is slightly more efficient.</p>


    <h4> What are the children?</h4>

    <p> One of the things that simplifiles the above binary tree search is that,at each choice point,you ignore all previous
        choies.previous choices don't give you any information about do next;as far as you know,both the left and the
        right child are possible solutions.in many problems,however,you may be able to eliminate children immediately,without
        recursion
    </p>

    <p>  Consider,for example,the problem of four-coloring a map.it is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane,no matter
        how convoluted the countries are,can be colored with at most four colours ,so that two countries that share a border are the
        same color.
    </p>

    <p> To color a map, you choose a color for first country,then a color for the secound country,and so on,until all countries are 
        colores.
    </p>

    <p> There are two ways to do this:</p>
      
    <ul>
        <li> Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors,and recur.when you run out of countries,check whether you are at a goal node.</li>
        <li> Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country,and recur.if and when you run out of
            countries,you have sucessfully colored the map.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable;aftr all,a
        checkeboard only needs two colors.
    </p>

    <h4> boolean mapls OK()</h4>
    <p> Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly. </p>

    <h4> boolean okToColor(introw,int column,int color)</h4>
    <p> used by method 2 to check,at every node,whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.</p>

    <h4> int[] nextRowAndColumn(inr row,int column)</h4>
    <p> Used by both methodes to find the next "country" ( actually,the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).</p>


    <p> Here's the code for method 1:</p>

    <pre>
        <font color="blue">

        boolean explore1(int row,int column,int color) {
          if(row>= NUM_ROWS)return maplsOK();
          map[row][column]=color;
          for (int nextColor=red;nextColor<=BLUE;nextColor++) {
            int[]next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
            if(explore1(next[0],next[1],nextColor))returntrue;
          }
          return false;
        }
    </font>

    </pre>

    <p> And here's the code for method 2:</p>

    <pre>
        <font color="blue">
       
        boolean explore2(int row,int column,int color) {
         if(row>=NUM_ROWS)return true;
         if(okToColor(row,colomn,color)) {
            map[row][column]=color;
            for(int nextColor=RED;nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
                int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
                if(explore2(next[0],next[1],nextColor))return true;
            }
            
        }
        return false;
    }    
</font>
    </pre>

    <p> Those appear pretty similar,and you might think are equally good.However,the timing information suggests otherwise</p>
    <table>
    <table border="1" align="center">
       <tr>
          <td lenth="40"> &nbsp;  </td>
          <td  color="grey"> 2by 3 map</td>
          <td> 3 by 3 map</td>
          <td>3 by 4 map</td>

    <p> The zero in the above table indicate times too short to measure(less than 1 millisecound).why this huge difference?Either of
        these methods could have exponential growth.Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents,and this will
        often prevent exponential growth.conversely by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached,exponential growth is practically
        guaranteed.if there is any way to eliminate children(reduce the set of choices),do so!
    </p>

    <h2> Debugging techniques</h2>

    <p> Often our first try at a program doesn't work,and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful,but sometimes we need to fall
        back on inserting print statments.There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statments.These tricks can be
        applied to any program,but are especially usefulwhen you are trying to debug recursive routines.
    </p>

    <h4> Trick#1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</h4>

    <p> Often,the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones).You probably
        want to print,for each method,what parameters it came in with,and what value it leaves with.However,if you just print a long
        list of these,it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries.Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
    </p>
    <h3> Trick#2: use specialized print methods for debugging.</h3>
    <p> Don't clutter up your actual code more then you must.Also,remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself
        contain bugs,or (in the wrost case) can affect the results,so be very careful with it.
    </p>

    <p> Here's our debugging code.For this trivial program,there's almost more debugging code then actual code,but in large programs
        the proportions will be bwtter.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <font color="blue">

        static String indent ="";

        static string name(BinaryTreenode){
            if(node==null)return null;
            else return node.name;
        }


          static void enter(Binary tree node){
            System.out.println(indent+"Entering solvable("+name(node)+")");
            indent=indent+"|";
          }


          static boolean no (binary tree node){
            indent=indent.substring(3);
            system.out.printin(indent+"solvable("+name(node)+")returns false");
            return false;
          }
        </font>
    </pre>
    
    <p> To use this code,we modify solvable as follows:</p>

    <pre>
        <font color="blue">
        Static boolean solvable(Binary Tree node){
          enter(node);
          if(node==null)return no (node);
          if(node.isGoalNode)return yes(node);
          if(solvable(node.left Child)) return yes(node);
          if(solvable(node.right Child)) return yes(node);
          return no(node);
        } 
    </font> 
    </pre>

    <p> And we get these results:</p>
    <pre>
        Entering solvable(Root)
        | Entering solvable(A)
        || Entering solvable(C)
        ||| Entering solvable(null)
        |||solvable(null) returns false
        ||| Entering solvable(null)
        ||| solvable(null)returns false
        || solvable(C) returns false
        || Entering solvable(D)
        ||| Entering solvable(null)
        ||| solvable(null)returns false
        || solvable(D)returns false
        | solvable(A)returns false
        | Entering solvable(B)
        || Entering solvable(E)
        || solvable(E)returns true
        | solvable(B)returns true
        solvable(Root)returns true
        true    

    </pre>

    <h4> Trick#3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h4>

    <p> Writing debugging statements is programming,too.Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug
        the actual program.Once your program is working,why throw this code away?
     </p>

     <p> Obviously,you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit(or to turn over to
        your manager).You could comment out your debugging calls,but that can be a lot of work.What's more,in the above example,
        you would have to replace every return(yes(node))with return(true),and every return(no(node)) with return false.With all These
        cganges,you might introduce new bugs into your program.
     </p>
     <p> The simple solution is to make your debugging statments conditional.for example,</p>

     <pre>
        <font color="blue">
            static final boolean debugging = false;


            static void enter(Binary Treenode) {
               if(debugging){
                system.out.printin(indent+"Entering solvable("+name(node)+")")
                indent=indent +"|";
               }  
            }
            
            
            static boolean yes(Binary Tree node){
                if(debugging){
                    indent=indent.substring(3);
                    system.out.println(indent+"solvable("+name(node)+")returns true");
                }
                return true;
            }
            
            
            static boolen no (BinaryTreenode){
                if(debugging){
                    indent=indent.substring(3);
                    system.out.println(indent+"solvable("+name(node)+")returns false");

                }
                return false;
            }  

        </font>
     </pre>

     <p>
        in industry,actual programs often have multiple flags to control diffrernt aspects of debugging.don't worry too much about
        making your code larger;modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final.it can never be true,and the
        controlled code will be discarded.

     <h4> Trick#4:Create an Exception.</h4>

     <P>
        if an exception is thrown,you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message
        printstack trace(PrintStream).Since an Exception is an object like any other,you can create and throw your own Exceptions.
        However,java programmers don't always realize that you can create an exception without throwing it. for example,the following
        code
     </P>

     <pre>
        <font color="blue">
            new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(systen.out);

        </font>
     </pre>

     <p>
        will print out a message something like this,and the program will then continue normally.that is the above code just acts like a
        print statement.
     </p>
     <pre>
        <font color="blue">

    <h4> Example:Cindy's Puzzle</h4>
    <p> I call the followings puzzle "cindy's puzzle" for historival reasons.you have some number n of black marbles and the same number
        of white marbles,and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in.start with
        the black marbles all at one end(say,theleft),the white marbles all at the other end,and a free space in between

    The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean.in solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,
    which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible.This isn't so easy.
   </p>
   
   
   <P> now to the program.The main program will initiallize the board,and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the
    puzzle.The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path,or it will fail,and the main program will have to
    print out the bad news.
   </P>

    The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. in solvable we shall need to check whether we are a leaf,
    which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible.This isn't so easy 
   </p>

   <p>
    Each possible move will result in a new board position,and these new board positions are the chidren of the current board
    position.hence to find the children of a node(that is of a board position),we need only find the possible moves from that node.
    remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.
   </p>

   <p>
    here is time to stop and take though.To make progress.we must analyze the game to some extent.probably a number of
    approaches would work,and what follows is based on the way i worked out.if you wewe to program this puzzle,you might find
    a different but equally valid apporach.
   </p>
   <p>
    first,notice that if a marble has a move,that move is unique:if it can move ahead one squre,it cannot jump.if it can jump,
    it cannot move ahead one square.This suggests that,to find the possibe moves,we might assign numbers to the marbles,and 
    board each time to find the marble we want.neither alternative is vary attractive.
   </p>


   <p><b>
    Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program.just check,in order,the 2n+1 spaces of the board.for each
    space,either zero or one moves in possible.With this understanding,we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board,int
    position) which determines whether a move is possible from give position:
   </b></p>

   <ul>
    <li> if the position is emptty,no move is possible;</li>
    <li> if the position contains a black marble,the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
    <li> if the position contains a white marble,the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p> we are another method<b> int[] make move(int[]oldBoard,int position)</b>that will take a board and a position,make a move form
    that position,and return as its value a new board.(we could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board,
    rather then creating a new one,but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon,makeMove is "applicative"
    rather then "muttive."
</p>

<p> Along with <b> can Move and makeMove,</b> we are using methods<b> puzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings
    that should be obvious.
</p>

    boolean solvable(int[]board){

            return true;
        }
        for(int position=0;position <BOARD_SIZE;position++)
        if(canMove(board,position)){
            int[]newBoard = makeMove(board,position);
            if(solvable(newBoard)){
                printBoard(newboard);

    16.<B> WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</B>
    15.<B> WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK BLACK</B>
    14.<B> WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</B>

    8. <B> WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</B>
    7. <B> _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</B>
    6. <B> BLACK _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</B>
    5. <B> BLACK BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE</B>
    4. <B> BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE</B>
    3. <B> BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE</B>
    2. <B> BLACK BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE WHITE WHITE</B>
    1. <B> BLACK BLACK BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE WHITE</B>
</pre>

<P>
Notice that the solutions is given in revese order:BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right,as in the last
line.l've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point.Backtracking always produces its
results(sequence of choices)in reverse order;it is up to you,the programmer,to reverse the result again to get
them in the correct order.
